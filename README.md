# Well, Well, Well Tanzania; Water Worries?

Flatiron Phase 3 Project, by Kelsey Lane, Andy Schmeck and Ted Brandon

This repository has been created to present a data analytical approach to help an NGO predict failure of water wells in Tanzania.  This document is intended to bridge the gap between technical and non-technical audiences.

## Repository Contents:

Technical Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) containing all data analysis
Matching pdf of the above notebook
Project presentation slides (pdf)

## Overview:

## Business Problem
Summary of the business problem you are trying to solve, and the data questions that you plan to answer to solve them.

Questions to consider:
	• Who are your stakeholders?
	• What are your stakeholders' pain points related to this project?
	• Why are your predictions important from a business perspective?

## Data Understanding
Describe the data being used for this project.

Questions to consider:
	• Where did the data come from, and how do they relate to the data analysis questions?
	• What do the data represent? Who is in the sample and what variables are included?
	• What is the target variable?
	• What are the properties of the variables you intend to use?

## Data Preparation
Describe and justify the process for preparing the data for analysis.

Questions to consider:
	• Were there variables you dropped or created?
	• How did you address missing values or outliers?
	• Why are these choices appropriate given the data and the business problem?

## Modeling

Describe and justify the process for analyzing or modeling the data.
Questions to consider:
	• How did you analyze or model the data?
	• How did you iterate on your initial approach to make it better?
	• Why are these choices appropriate given the data and the business problem?

## Evaluation
Evaluate how well your work solves the stated business problem.

Questions to consider:
	• How do you interpret the results?
	• How well does your model fit your data? How much better is this than your baseline model?
	• How well does your model/data fit any modeling assumptions?
	• How confident are you that your results would generalize beyond the data you have?
	• How confident are you that this model would benefit the business if put into use?

## Conclusions
Provide your conclusions about the work you've done, including any limitations or next steps.
Questions to consider:
	• What would you recommend the business do as a result of this work?
	• What are some reasons why your analysis might not fully solve the business problem?
	• What else could you do in the future to improve this project (future work)?
